# Social media dashboard with theme switcher

This is my submission for the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H) based on the live coding session of [Leonidas Esteban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScSHSI7TzRw)

What I enjoy most about this project is that it allowed me to learn about the media query used to identify if the user has configured their system to use a light or dark color theme, and also learn about the use of css variables in a vanilla project.
